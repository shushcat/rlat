    To the right Honorable Sir Roger North
    knight Lord North Baron of Cart-
    ledg {Kirtling} and High Steward of the
    Dutchie G:N: wishes
    all Honorable felicity

As Nature's skill in all living creatures (Right Honorable) is sunderly shown by the greatness of her several gifts (with care that each condition be coupled in equality like itself), so the virtuous mind, feeling by secret motion that time, travel, and experience does beautify the best of her labors, endeavors every way (by industry) to supply

# 0v

her defects by art.  According to the golden counsel of that grave Philosopher who wills us oft to view out own proportion in a glass, whose form and feature, if we find fair and worthy, to frame our affections accordingly, if otherwise she have (by skill or will) deformed our outward appearance and left us odible to the eye of the world, then (to cure shadow, or salve the same) so to govern and guide our behavior, and so to moderate our inward man, as Nature herself may seem to be deceived in us.  Whereunto no cunning can easier attain than

# 1

by making our own minds true mirrors of all our actions.  What sentence has more sweeter grace, or may be better said of any Christian, than the same that is spoken of the ethnic HORACE: Hic murus aheneus esto: nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa: To be ever clear in conscience, from blushing crime, and free in self conceit from pale fear is a firm fort and brazen bastillion to the best liars in either fortune.  All breathing creatures are subject to sundry accidents, whereof some seem natural and some casual, which both (though dangerous) well considered of, are to life most

# 1v

necessary as the best mean to make us know our own weak frailties and the sooner to come to the true knowledge of ourselves, which is one argument of my Muse that I presume to trouble your Lordship withal.
Most writers in English (both for invention and translation) do excel in this age (among whom Master T.N. {Thomas North}, your L{ordship's} brother, for copy, eloquency, and good method, may claim palm and place with the best, and wherein long since I knew your L{lordship} to take great

delight) unto whose flowing virtues of well doing; though my desert be far off (wanting both skill and countenance to advance my style), yet my desire dares as near as may be, following the precept of that most famous painter Apelles, who never suffered the sun to pass his full course over him without drawing at the least some one line, whereof proceeds this familiar proverb, Nulla dies sine linia {No day without a line}.  I have entitled this short treatise the treasure that traitors in time attain to: an argu-

# 2v

ment for the ripest wits to write of, wherein I hope my offence is as single as my meaning is simple.  I reprove the hateful fates in treason, I declaim against the disobedient, and I frame a certain fury to the rigor of obstinate rebels, in all which actions (observing decorum generally) I am not Timon, enemy to mankind, nor Diogenes Cynic, the barker at others' behavior, neither have I played prating Pasquil of Rome, I scoff not with Democritus, nor I rage not (though vehement in part) with

# 3

Heraclitus: But I only entered the labyrinth of this labor to show the comfortable conflict between tediousness, idleness, and a willing mind, which two first monsters, being by the last vanquished and the victory with triumph concluded, I presently presumed to enter on the imagination to present the same to your Lordship, whose noble favor I am bound so to regard, as during life I acknowledge duty insufficient to discharge the benefits that your gracious countenance has sunderly bestowed upon

# 3v

me.

    Most humbly craving of your
    L{ordship} to accept this rude and unpolished
    penning in lieu of a worthi-
    er work, since
    the same
    proceeds from the bare and barren breast
    of him whose glad de-
    sire would gratify
    you with greater gi-
    fts if scarceness of
    skill mastered not
    my best mea-
    ning.

    your L{ordship's} most

    A brief discourse of rebellion and rebels,
    wherein is show the
    tresure that traitors in the execution of their treason by time at-
    tain to.

    The best and most perfect mirror of man's misery, to know himself and the sundry assaults of Fortune (his lofty rising and low falling, his fawning prosperity and fearful adversity, his wretchedness overwhelmed with common calamity, and his pride puffed up with endless arrogance, his unmeasurable mirth, his causeless sorrow, his happy health promising life ever his

# 4v

sudden sickness and momentary death) is to see into himself and with himself to contemplate the infinite chances and changes that by a secret instinct of Nature every mortal creature seems to be subject unto.  Who lives so short time, if his life pass any years, that finds and seals not in himself the benefit of his Maker, the mercy of his Redeemer, and the unspeakable comfort of his Savior?  All which his gracious gifts, as they are equally divided in respect of our equality before his Divine Majesty, so the difference is great by our own sinful frailty, in the true use and abuse of them.  For as by fleshly infirmity we fall, forgetting his bounty and our duty, so willfully divide we (by

# 5

hateful desert) his blessing from us, when lusting like Io (after Argus's death) for liberty, we run headlong into Egypt for the same.  The poets of times past had great reason in their metaphorical examples to induce birds and beasts for man's better precedent, thereby to show our brutish weakness, which is ever most prone and ready to linger in liking of his contrary.  They at the first (by searching the hidden secrets of Nature) found what we by daily experience prove, for by their great study and labor, they have laid before us the true condition and natural inclination of all things: by whose wonderful writings

# 5v

and works we learn that most living creatures have placed in them a special rule to obey.
With what foresight to provide, with what diligence to gather, and with what care to keep do the small bodied ants graciously and gently impart their labors, one with the other, only to support their little commonwealth withal.  Some fetch from far as purveyors for the rest, whose burdens (by the way) if they be too great how many helping hands are glad and willing to offer themselves.  Some divide and lay up their store, as principal preservers of the same, and some as a guard or scout keep watch for all, who are (if

# 6

occasion be offered) assisted by the whole multitude.  Their simple city or common mansion is also separated into three several parts: one (as a Parliament house) for a place of public repair, the other (as most necessary) to bury their dead, and the third (whereof they have no small care) is to preserve their provision in, which store, if (either by moisture of the earth or otherwise by rain) it begins to corrupt, they naturally choose and use the benefit of seasonable time, bringing it by piecemeal abroad to dry, which argues that all their mutual actions is guided and governed by order, industry , and obedience.

# 6v

Bees have their special leader, whom they so much honor and reverence, as they will no day depart the hive before they have presented duty and saluted him; they labor every one for themselves and all for their king: he has his several mansion, imperially placed among them; it is only lawful for him to enter any their private combs.
I read that on a time, the weather being cold, a buzzing drone came to a hive requesting some relief, of whom they asked how he had spent the warm season of the year: I have (said he) all summer passed through the country singing; the best is then (quote they) all the winter

# 7

to wander the same way dancing.
By this it appears they allow no lazy flyers among them in their commonwealth.
They endure no idle bee, except their king, in whom it is tolerable, to feed on all their travels: they naturally both fear and favor him, for at home they obey him and abroad they follow him and carefully accompany him every way; they gladly support his age, rejoicing in his life, and sorrowfully (by a solemn mean of ceremony) seem to bewail his death.
These small beasts, the ant and bee, with many others, by Nature's motion are moved to observe order in all things.

# 7v

But man, being made Lord and Master over all, whose excellency of memory and reasonable judgment so heaves up his haughty mind as commonly he declines from the precious price and value of his own virtue and contrary to kind (corrupting Nature, forgetting the image and end whereunto he was first framed) yields himself by stubborn disobedience to a baser condition than the brutest beast that is would do.
What wight so wretched, what monster so mad, or what life so savage, in whom reasonable discretion ought

# 8

to occupy place, that sees not with open sight the absurdity of his own weakness, the detestable intent of his own vileness, and the damnable horror of self devices when ambitious desire kindles sedition, treachery, treason, and uproar rebellion.
When God made the Heavens, he set a law between sea and shore, light and darkness, the sun, the moon, the stars, and firmament (his first works) which unto our age have continued, every planet and element, in mutual duty to either, such due obedience as their Maker commanded. Among which

# 8v

heavenly bodies, if rebellion at any time had entered, the world long since had come to confusion in all things.  If the loftiest Angels were cast to the lowest Hell for rebelling against God, what better hope can rebels have that resist by uproar his ministers: for he who spared not his celestial creatures will less spare man, seeing they offend his divine pleasure as much in his anointed as in himself.
Adam received his first overthrow by transgressing the commandment and resisting the pleasure of God that placed him in Paradise {Gen. 3:17}, whose private rebellion then

# 9

has been and still shall be (by sin and death) publicly punishable in mankind forever.  God did strike Miriam with horrible leprosy for murmuring against Moses {Num. 12:10}.  The Israelites were plagued with fiery serpents for murmuring and grudging at their Magistrate Moses {Num. 21:6}.
Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, only for disdaining that Moses should reign over them, were swallowed up of the earth, and they, their wives, children, and all their goods driven down alive to Hell {Num. 16:31}.
Absalom was miserably slain for rebelling against David his father; Achitophel

# 9v

hanged himself and 20,000 men put to the sword that took his part {2 Sam. 17:23}.
Sheba lost his head for conspiring against King David {2 Sam. 20:22}.
Zimri conspired against Elah, King of Israel, slew him, and reigned in his stead, but after he was driven into that misery, as he burned himself {1 Reg. (Liber Regum --- i.e., 1 Kings) 16:18}.
Theudas and Judas were two seditious persons boasting to do great things and counseling the Jews by no means to pay tribute to Caesar, but to maintain their old rights and liberties {Acts 5:36--37}.  What became of them?  Were they not put to death, and so many as followed them either slain or scattered?

# 10

It is not to be read, in all the Holy Scriptures, that any traitor or notable seditious person has at any time escaped without notable and famous punishment.  God will not suffer his Magistrates to be disobeyed, his commonwealths to be disturbed, his laws to be condemned, and his godly and honest orders to be broken.
Whosoever attempts any such wickedness, God will in time be revenged on him as it is evident not only in the Sacred Scriptures but also in profane histories.  Therefore, if the devil by deadly suggestion at any time persuades us that the King Magistrate or higher powers do not their duty in the right government of the commonwealth,

# 10v

but cruelly oppress their subjects, and therefore we may justly rise and rebel against them and take upon us our private authority to redress what is amiss, let us beware and wisely take heed by no means to consent to this most subtle and wicked temptation, whereby he goes about to throw us into utter damnation of soul, besides a shameful death convenient to our desert, and the loss of all that we have.
Louis XII of France would needs persuade a gentleman of his court to come in to England with a melancholy message to King Henry VIII, who, knowing the mighty mind and

# 11

high condition of our Prince, humbly craving pardon (objecting the danger and foreshowing the peril), said: I doubt most gracious Sovereign, lest the King of England, misliking so arrogant and haughty a tale from the mouth of so base a messenger, will pole me for my over saucy prating unto him.  By Saint Dennis (quotes the King) if he do so, it shall cost me 40,000 heads in revenge of it.  I humbly than your Majesty, replied the gentleman, but I doubt no one head of those 40,000 will serve my shoulders so well as mine own.  So where wise men in time foresee their own surety and stand upon the guard of their honest safety, when any such devilish motion

# 11v

is made them will answer (thereunto) as this gentleman did his master.
Let us imagine the mind of a desperate traitor (excepting neither person nor cause in regard of subject's duty) and set before us the examples of how many thousands that from the beginning have attempted, and so few achieved, the hateful effect of their traitorous desires, and then shall perfectly appear the fruits and fine of rebellion, the assured success of rebels, and the just reward prepared for their punishments here besides the gaping of Hell gates, the only devouring gulf, for their endless perdition elsewhere.
Wicked are they (says Peter) and damnable

# 12

shall they be that despise authority and fear not to speak evil of them that excel in honor {2 Pet. 2:10--11}.
If I seem over vehement to any in appertaining such corrupt and cankered members as they are, I am to answer with PHILIP of MACEDON being complained to by certain citizens who had revolted from their vowed Prince and found themselves grieved at the reproach of his soldiers that called them traitors: your wisdoms and patience (quotes he) must bear with their barbarous speech, since such as are rude and bare of eloquence can no way term a spade but a spade.  Though my calling be not to sound the depth of so weighty causes, nor my

# 12v

credit of value to daunt so dangerous an enemy or to encounter with so cruel a monster as treason is, yet reasonable authority (with some experience) tells me that war from the beginning has ever been feared, unjust war hated, but civil war (the only triumph of traitors) in all ages most detested.
Considerati hominis est, jure decertare, armis non contendere {Cice. pro Cecin}: Profound and wise men are to decide causes and controversies by the equity of law and not by the rigor of weapon.  Parva sunt foris arma, nisi est consilium domi {Cice: 11. off:}: The judgment that defines causes by reasonable counsel and conference at home

# 13

is more commendable than the same that is tried by martial force abroad.

Nihil viro bono et quieto, et bono civi magis convenit quam abesse a civilibus controversiis {Cice: Att: lib. 9}: Nothing is more meet to a good and quit subject, or more convenient to a careful citizen,than to shun the hateful controversy of civil contention.  Nihil est equitati tam contrarium, atque infestum, quam convocati armatique homines: nihil juri tam inimicum quam vis {Cice: pro Cecin}: Nothing is to equity more pernicious and contrary than uproar and armed men; nothing is to law more enemy than force.  Nihil est {enim} exitiosius civitatibus, nihil tam contrarium juri et legibus, nihil minus civile et humanum, quam constituta et composita Respub{lica}, quidquam


# 13v

agi per vim {Cice: le: 3}: Nothing is to cities more execrable or to justice and laws more contrary, nor anything less civil and honest than in a well governed and quiet commonwealth to do or attempt anything by violence.
Omnia sunt misera in bellis civilibus, sed miserius nihil, quam ipsa victoria {Cice: Marcel: fami: lib: 12}: All things in civil war is most miserable, and nothing more miserable or wretched than victory, for to whether side it falls, the conqueror has no cause to triumph.  Civile bellum perniciosissimum {Cice: Attic: lib. 8}: Civil war is most damnable and pernicious.
Infinite are the examples that show what sorrows follow it: but more infinite are the cursèd calamities that such miserable experience brings with it.  In the year 1478, Florence,

# 14

one of the most famous cities in all Italy, was in that happy state as it seemed fortune could no way overthrow it.  It flourished so for peace and wealth above the rest.  At which time Julian and Laurence de Medici, both brethren, did govern the state there: who managed their affairs with such felicity, as their reputation grew great with the nobility and commons, no less for the fame of their former worthiness than for their equity in justice and gracious government over them.  These were deadly envied at by the families of Pazzi and Salviati in such hateful sort, as they, regarding neither the quietness of their country, the ruin of their houses, nor the utter overthrow

# 14v

of themselves, blinded by ambition (as all traitors are), desirous of alteration, coveting superiority, neglecting obedience, content with no government but condemning authority and disdaining to be subjects to any, determined the destruction of these two noble gentlemen and the hazard of their commonwealth withal.  Francis and John de Pazzi undertook this damnable decree, joining with them Francis Salviati, Archbishop of Pisa, the better to perform this enterprise.  The council approved and all things meet provided: the Archbishop comes from Pisa to Florence, colorably conveying into the city certain numbers of

# 15

soldiers.  The conspirators concluded the deaths of the Medicis, to be both in one place and at one instant: in the cathedral church, when the priest (according to the ceremony in the best of their mass) should lift up the Sacrament.  Although it be abuse, as many Divine defines it, yet does it manifest the execrable intent of traitors, who regard neither place, presence, nor time to execute their hateful homicide.  To commit murder anywhere is odible: in the church more abhorred, and in the best of their sacred service (as they accounted it) most of all to be detested.
This mischief begun, and in Julian per-

# 15v

formed the tumult in the church kindled the uproar in the city raised and the people in arms: the Pazzi and Salviati cry liberty, the only mark and end that all traitors tend to.
But God, whose mercy is mightiest when man's misery is nearest, preserved by divine providence Lorenzo de Medici, so as with some slender hurt he recovered the chancel for his sureguard, till the better sort (enemies to sedition and favorers of fealty) reinforced themselves with duty and courage to encounter this common calamity to all.  And as it was by time devised and suddenly executed, so was it with like celerity fronted, and by the diligence of good sub-

# 16

jects clean overcome.  For in less than three hours, Julian de Medici was murdered, the Archbishop with most of the confederates hanged, and all the houses of the conspirators sacked.
This is the fruits and fine of rebels, that while they dream of alteration by indirect means, and trust thereby to advance their state, do in a moment lost honors, goods, liberties, and lives to the fearful fall of their friends and dreadful danger of their country.
In the time of the Emperor Frederick II and Pope Gregory IX, there sprang up in the city of Pistoia (for

# 16v

ambition) two factions, the one called Guelphs, the other Ghibellines, which controversy by little and little so spread through Italy, as all seditions rising among them, by title of treason or private malice, were termed Guelphs and Ghibellines.  Anthony, Archbishop of Florence, affirms that 35 of the most famous and noblest houses of Florence were by these factions clean undone, spoiled, ruined, and razed to the earth, besides many thousand thousands murdered, great numbers banished, many families distressed, and infinite Princely bastiments and

# 17

buildings with fire and flame consumed.  Such is the ripe rancor of ambitious treason, such is the mischief of a rebellious multitude, and such is the fruits and fury of forlorn villainy, when the fear of God, favor to their country, and duty to their Prince is clean bereft them.
What ruins brought civil wars to Rome as between Pompey and Caesar, Brutus and Cassius, and between Octavin and Mark Antony, ambition in the mightier, and liberty in the lower sort, was ever the cause.
The horrible destruction of Jerusalem came of rebellion, for, as Suetonius and Cornelius Tacitus affirm, the Jews first revolted from

# 17v

the Romans under the cruel Nero, whereunto they were stirred by contrary seeming a certain prophecy that said: about those days, the affairs of the East should be greatly advanced, and how one should (then) be born among them that should conquer the world.  This, simply and singly taken, made them forget their duty and presume on promised fortune, where indeed the Prophet spiritually meant our Savior Christ, that took his beginning at Jerusalem and from thence spread (to the comfort of all Christians) through the whole world.
Titus and Vespasian punished this rebellion

# 18

with the slaughter of six hundred thousand Jews bearing armor, with ninety seven thousand that were sold for slaves, besides infinite numbers (as Joseph and {H}Egesippus say) that perished of famine and necessity.  Dio Cassius recited that Hadrian the Emperor (who restored them to their city and re-edified it again), for their rebelling against him, put to the sword fifty thousand fighting men besides the weaker sort, women and children, all cut in pieces, razed fifty of their forts, burned and ruined 985 towns and villages, and banished all Jews from any the confines of Jewry forever.
Such and so great is the divine punishment of

# 18v

God for rebellion, as he forbids it in his elect, though subjects either to tyrants or infidels.
For the Lord said, by the mouth of Esau, when the captains entered the gates of Babylon: I have commanded my Sanctified, and I have called my strong people, to the end they may triumph in my glory.
The Prophet spoke this by King Darius and Cyrus, naming the Medes and Persians his Sanctified, who were neither holy nor just but only executors of his blessed will.  He also says, by Ezekiel, I will lead my servant Nebuchadnezzar, and for that he served me well at Tyrus, I will give him also Egypt {Ezek. 29:18--19--20},

# 19

yet were they not the servants of God, for they neither knew him nor believed in him, but only instruments of his justice.
The cruel Totila, King of the Goths, was called the scourge of God, and the great Tamburlaine, who overran so many provinces and overcame so many Princes, would most barbarously upbraid those he vanquished, saying: What other do you account of me than the ire, wrath, and indignation of God?  Yet he commanded that those tyrants should be obeyed.
For whatsoever he be that is a King (be it by title of inheritance, succession, bequest,

# 19v

common consent, or election) is undoubtedly chosen of God to be his deputy, and whosoever resists any such withstands God himself, and are rank traitors and rebels.  They have not cast thee away, but me (said God to Samuel) that I should not reign over them {1 Sam. 8:7}.
The Lord has heard your murmurings (says Moses) which you murmur against him.
For what are we (he speaks of himself and of Aron); your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord {Exod. 16:8}.  But if our sin provoke the Deity to place and appoint such Magistrates over us,

# 20

whose cruel government suspends goods, liberty, and lives in doubtful state, and that privately and publicly everyone finds just cause of complaint, yet we should and ought still to acknowledge our Prince, leaving both redress and revenge to him who guides (either to the suppressing of vice or advancement of virtue) the hearts of Kings, at his omnipotent pleasure.  Princes are God's lieutenants.  Wherefore the Scriptures forbid us to rebel or forcibly to withstand any decree or ordinance of theirs: yea, though they command unjust things.
Thou shalt do (says the Prophet) whatsoever they say unto thee, that be rulers

# 20v

over the place which the Lord has chosen {Deut. 17:10}.  Whosoever he be (says God) that disobeys thy mouth, and will not harken unto thy words in all that thous command him, let him die {Josh. 1:18}.
And if our conscience will not bear the burden they lay upon us, either let us guiltily suffer the punishment for refusal or dutifully shun the same we fear.  Better is willful banishment than bold contempt; better is boor exile than conspiring revenge; yea, much better is painful persecution than hateful rebellion.  We ought to live in obedience to the higher powers

# 21

whatsoever they be.
Mary and Joseph obeyed the Emperor's commandment and went into Bethlehem to be taxed {Luke 2:5}.
Christ paid tribute to Caesar for him and his disciples and willed other to do so {Math. 17:27}.
Christ even to the death obeyed the temporal rulers {Math. 27}.
Saint Paul obeyed willingly the public Magistrates Felix and Festus {Acts 24}.  For as justice is a chief virtue, so is the administration of it the chiefest office, and therefore has God established and confirmed it with a noble and honorable title, calling them Kings and terming them yet more higher, by his own name, Gods.
In the first age of man, when the eyes of his spiritual understanding were sealed

# 21v

up and while the clouds of error over-covered and kept him from the true knowledge of himself, he was so meshed in the smothering mists of ignorance, as every idol was an oracle and everyone that found out the use of anything canonized a God.  Yet among those barbarous conditions such as were, their Kings and rulers (that well deserved of them) had their dead bodies embalmed and (to common judgment) solemnized with divine funerals, and their images forever (to their liking) honored, with celestial sacrifices.  Look what affection they bear them

# 22

in their lives, the same would they show at and after their deaths.
The Persian Princes were with great pomp (being dead) conveyed and carried over their country, and when they came to the place of their burial, the chiefest and dearest beloved of him (in his life) would joyfully enter the tomb with him: not compelled, but contending who should be found most worthy for the same.
This Pagan right may be (metaphorically taken) a Christian precedent of true love and obedience for us to our Kings and Princes, whose gracious governments we

# 22v

ought so to regard as willing favor, not grudging fear, should cause us at all times to lay our goods, liberties, and lives under the obedient yoke of their correction.
The Great Duke of Muscovy and Emperor of Russia Alba (or of White Russia) in the year 1560 sent an ambassador to Sigismund, then King of Poland, with commission to solicit a marriage between his Master and the King's youngest sister (whom Duke John of Finland, now King of Sweden, has married), whose hot desire, for that it had not wished success, he

# 23

revenged upon his poor messenger, whom he caused at his return to be torn in pieces with dogs.
This half Christian Muscovite (well known by the trade of our merchants unto us) holds his subjects in such hateful vassalage: as using their deaths for delightful pastimes (to show his power over them to such strangers and ambassadors as come unto him), he commands their lives to what torment it pleases him.
Sigismund, the last King of Poland (mentioned of afore), in the year 1562, named Stanislaus Baptist, Palatine of Krakow,

# 23v

for ambassador to Sultan Suleiman, then the Great Turk, at whose goodwill one Quashnofsky, a gentleman of less nobility (more for covetous desire of hoped reward than for credit or countenance of the message), obtained the same.  The Turk (at his coming to Constantinople), hearing how he had purchased the honor of his journey, determined by a  terrible mean to teach him what it was to approach the presence of so mighty a Prince.  And therefore, at the appointed time of his audience, he made a lane (or a ward) of lions, leopards, tigers, and other fearful beasts through the which

# 24

our Polack must needs pass and, in the midst of them, deliver his embassy.  How boldly he bore himself!  How ripely and rightly he remembered his instructions, and with what wisdom or modesty he executed his commission (when his trembling tongue, terrified on either side, was tied to the roof of his mouth) is easily to be imagined.  Suleiman, seeing him so perplexed, not able to discharge the cause of his coming but standing like a silent shadow (to augment his fear, with a stern countenance), asked him whether he thought the hope of his bounty or the might of his Majesty to be greatest: whether he now found

# 24v

his weakness insufficient and unworthy to purchase (by dishonorable mean) the embassage to so puissant a Prince as the great Sultan was.  But that thou shalt (said he) return and bear with thee the shameful reproach of thy arrogant folly, I would otherwise punish thy over-base presumption, and thus, without credit or reward, he dismissed him his court and country.
This barbarous infidel has his people in so great obedience that their yielding deaths are ever ready to his tyrannical pleasure, as though their lives were first framed only by

# 25

him and at his disposition.
These damnable tyrannies: as I detest and abhor them in Princes, so do I commend and allow such rare obedience in subjects who will rather endure any lotted persecution than against the Majesty of their King stir up rebellion.  If the bonds of obedience be so regarded under tyrants and with barbarous infidels who have no knowledge of Christ but only instructed by the law of Nature, how much more ought it with us to be had in price and reverence, being taught our duty by the Sacred Scriptures and commanded thereunto by God himself.

# 25v

Marcus Aurelius used to thank the immortal Gods (and greatly to glory) in that he was born a man and not a woman, free and not bound, (and chiefly) a Roman and not a Barbarian.  If he had a reason so to do, being far from the true taste of Christ, not knowing the unspeakable comfort and liberty of his Gospel, what greater cause of glory and gladness may we have whom Nature has delivered into the world under a free government, whose place of birth gives us the badge of Christians, which is a more triumphant title than to be termed Romans.  But we, forgetting the benefit of his bounty (whose cognizance we

# 26

outwardly carry, whose followers, like hypocrites, we feign to be, whose profession unworthily we presume upon), by obstinate rebellion against him in his anointed, make ourselves more hateful unto him than either Roman, Pagan, or Barbarian.  Our beastly brutishness, by willful contempt, is more odible in the eye of God than the weak ignorance either of Muscovite or Turk.  Their loyal simplicity, in regard of our obstinate arrogance, argues the worthiness of both.
When we be nearest our own frail will, then are we farthest from our Master Christ.  When we lay the rein of rashness

# 26v

on our necks, and take the bit of disobedience in our teeth, having no commanding government to guide us, no authority to withhold us, nor any law to check or bridle us, we run like headstrong hopelosts into all the evils that may be.  If authority stood on the slipper stay and state of the multitude (in whom there is neither reason, judgment, or discretion), then were it thrice miserable; but God made it more precious before him, for the people are naturally inclined to ingratitude, condemning most that best deserve of their commonwealth.  The famous Father of his Country and Sovereign Orator in the Latin tongue (M.T. Cicero),

# 27

who delivered Rome from the perilous conspiracy of Catiline, was notwithstanding (at the bare motion of his enemy Claudius) banished by the voice of the multitude.  Demosthenes, Prince of eloquence, for the Greek Servilius Halla, Metellus surnamed Numidicus, valiant Hannibal, and renowned Camillus, all patrons of their countries and preservers of their lives and liberties, were in the end banished by their own people.  Was ever commonwealth more bound to any member than Lacedemon was to their lawmaker Lycurgus, whose virtuous life merited such place of praise, as the oracle of Apollo accounted him rather to be a God than a man.  Yet was

# 27v

he oft of his own citizens chased with stones out of their city and in fine (one of his eyes torn out of his head) thrust into exile by them.  The like reward for well doing wise Solon received of the Athenians, whose grave counsel and godly precepts if they had kept and continued their empire, might have been perpetual, but he whose care was ever for his country could by no entreaty obtain (in the extremist of his age) so little a corner of it as might continue his loathed life to the end, but most cruelly was banished into the Isle of Cyprus forever.  Scipio Nasica, which was esteemed for one of the most worthiest in

# 28

Rome, who merited no less renown for managing the government at home than the other Scipions did by their famous valiancy abroad, notwithstanding, when he had delivered his country from the servile yoke of the Greeks, feeling the unthankful condition of his citizens and finding their envy to malice his virtue, feigned an embassy and willingly banished himself from his ungrateful country.
Cleisthenes was the first that made this law of banishment in Athens and was also the first himself that suffered the same punishment, whereby after many noble and notable persons were (through the fury of the multitude and by their most ingrate and cruel consents) thrust into utter

exile.  The vain voice of the common people is ever more readier to suppress the glory of the good than to supplant their own malicious infirmities, for they are contrary to reason in most of their actions.  And, therefore, Cicero says, the opinion of the multitude should rather be dissimuled at than allowed.  They are still contentious, envying nobility, and in all things seditious, desiring willful liberty, apt to uproar and ready to rebellion, condemning the wise and worthy if they gainsay their braying folly.  And whatsoever passes the compass of their simple capacity (be it never so carefully considered on by the Prince and Magistrates) the scan it among themselves according

to common judgment, metamorphosing the sense to private pleasure, and that which likes not their lusting appetite they contemptuously loathe and confound (withal) both law and lawmaker.  Surely their corrupt nature is such, as they cannot digest anything that tends to the advancement of the state, though it be most best and meetest for a good commonwealth.  The Majesty of God foreseeing at the first (by divine mystery) the maliciousness of his own work, and knowing by their great increase they would grow to imperfection, he appointed Kings to govern them and gave them swords to execute justice, to support the dutiful and to

daunt the stubborn, commanding due obedience in all and cursing any that murmur or repine against them.
By me (says the Holy Ghost by Solomon in his proverbs) Kings reign and Princes decree justice; by me Princes rule and noblemen and all judges of the earth {Prov. 8:15--16}.
The King's displeasure is a messenger of death, his cheerful countenance is life, and his loving favor is as the evening dew {Prov. 16:14--15}.
The King ought to be feared as the roaring of a lion; who so provokes him to anger offends against his own soul {Prov. 20:2}.
Whosoever will not fulfill God's law and the King's law, let him have his judgment without delay {1 Ezra 7:24}.

# 30

What may traitors then trust to when the curse and scourge of God does still accompany them and the Prince's power and sword does ever follow them, justly to pledge, and duly to persecute, their most hateful treason?
Will you see the true image of traitors?  Will you behold the perfect uproar of the people?  Will you regard the beastly rigor of rebellion?  And will you mark (by view of eye) the manifold mischiefs and execrable slaughters of sedition?  Then consider the calamity of the Low Countries, and look into the distressed government of those staggering states whose desperate disobedience against their King and Sovereign occupies all these parts

# 30v

of the world with slander of common murder and continual complaints of spoil.  Behold, to obey (says the Prophet) is better than sacrifice, and to harken is better than the fat of rams, for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft {1 Sam. 15:22--23}.
Let us then weigh their hateful beginning with their proud proceeding and so expect their end according to their merits.
How many have our Flemish faction afflicted?  What numbers banished?  How many thousands murdered?  What execrable act unexecuted?  Cities sacked, churches spoiled, and nothing unattempted that may offend the Majesty of God, the obedience to their Prince, and quietness to their country,

# 31

common enemies to civil government, condemning authority, impatient of order, detesting Magistrates, and claiming to themselves by colorable pretext the protection of ancient privileges and religion, when (in ore, corde, and intrinsecu) they be lupi rapaciores and shameless Anabaptists, only pretending liberty, as may appear by the havoc they make of all the world and as the misery of Münster not long since did manifest.
If reason might summon them to justice or equity, call their cause (in law) to account, then the wise would weigh them as they are, and the simplest that is should

# 31v

then see, whether in duty they ought to obey as subjects or by contempt ton contend like rebels, whether their quarrel was begun to defend profession or suggested by the Devil to maintain sedition.  Compare the particularities with the circumstance, and you shall easily find treason at the full.
Cardinal Granvelle (either commanded by his Prince or of his own noble nature) solicited the Lords of the Low Countries to consider what extremities the French King was in and to succor his imminent peril (whereof they were like to be partakers) with some present supply.  And therefore playing that

# 32

famous Demosthenes's part (with an oration no less learned than eloquent), he moved them to aide him, if not for his sake, whose sister their Sovereign should marry, yet for their own surety (by wisdom, foresight, and policy) to prevent the furies and flames of France, which threatened ruin to themselves, seeing the warm blood of their so near neighbors was daily spread and sprinkled in their bosoms, fearing and foreshowing the unhappy sequel that ensued.
To whose wise presage the Earl of Egmond replied that to help their so ancient an enemy were only to increase his strength to their decay, supposing those foreign broils to breed quietness among them with

# 32v

assertion that the less they favored the French the more they loved themselves, and therefore to assist so doubtful a friend, and so unthankful a confiner, should wholly turn to their own damage and detriment, condemning all counsel that would consent thereunto.  The Cardinal, knowing the haughty mind of the Earl (and finding his vehement dissuasion to taste more of contempt than of countries' care), answered: My Lord, it appears the remembrance of your late victory makes you yet maligned against them, and, as by that overthrow you won yourself honor, so with continual disdain you would still be a conqueror, whereat the Earl was so grieved as forgetting the place, presence, and person (choler

# 33

surmounting reason, with words of reproach), he gave the Cardinal a blow.
The Lord Granvelle, disdaining to endure so great a dishonor and not able without uproar to encounter so assured a faction, preferring public quietness before private revenge, departed the court and country for Spain and appealed to the Catholic King for justice.
Count Egmond, fearing over late that this folly would bring the Inquisition among them, he with the Prince of Orange and other the Lords called a council, where it was agreed that the Lord Brederode should go to the Lady Regent to request her letters to the King to pacify these causes, who, as he passed along by the court,

# 33v

her Grace looking out at a window, a gentleman that saw him coming said to her: Madam, Voyez ICI LES GUIS, behold the beggars.  One that unhappily overheard this met the Lord Brederode and told him of it, who, taking it contemptuously spoken, proceeded no further, but, presently putting on another mind, he returned, upon which occasion (shortly after) he invited the Lady Regent, the Prince of Orange, the Earl of Egmond, the Earl Horn, with other the Lords to a banquet, where, in the midst of their mirth, the Lord Brederode asked the Prince of Orange if he would pledge him on that condition and in the same cup that he would drink to him in, to whom, when the P{rince} answered

# 34

gladly, their host took out of his hose a wooden dish with a clack at it (lazar like) and, filling it with rhenish wine, said to the Prince, my Lord, I drink to you, and VIVE LES GUIS, God save the beggars, whereunto the Prince and whole company applied with the same sentence, crying all at one instant VIVE LES GUIS, God save the beggars.  Hereupon presently the people assistants (who are like Hydra's heads) to show themselves affected to this sudden faction (yet unknown to them) as the lords of gold, so they of silver, and some of tin according to quality and ability, all or most part, wear in their hats and caps cups with clacks hanging at them.  The worser sort of commons (according to their kind)

# 34v

ready to make any occasion authority for spoil and liberty, like Alecto's whelps, unbridled of all obedience, ran ragingly through Antwerp, spoiling churches and religious houses, ruining and renting down such monuments as pleased them, committing withal a number of secret murders and singing for their souls no other psalm than their first lesson VIVE LE{S} GUIS, God save the beggars.  Where was religion when the P{rince} of Orange was seen the same day (that these broils were in Antwerp) at the hearing of five Masses?
Where was religion when a poor English gentleman was executed by them, having no evidence to condemn him but a pair of garters gotten in the spoil, made of an altar

# 35

curtain?  Where was religion when all was pacified (or at least dissembled) and the Duke of Alva with precision received?
Where was religion when all allowed and none gainsaid the Catholic faith?
Was it religion when the Grave of Mark took the Brill desperately and Seras and Brederode surprised Flushing disorderly?
Was it religion, or the promise of liberty, that caused so many to rebel?
Was it religion, or the pin in the pot, that pinched them so near, to make them forget both Prince and profession?
Or is it religion that makes them spoil their best allied and confederate friends' goods (all subjects to one King) to support their private pomp

# 35v

and to pay their mercenary men?
And in conclusion, shall we account religion to be there where drunkenness is taken for delight, robbery allowed purchase, lechery regarded solace, murder thought honest revenge, and rebellious treason esteemed for the dutiful defense of ancient liberties and a commonwealth?
Then let us allow of our late Poet that has painted the world and worldly causes turned top under tail, saying:

All things are not turned upside down
God's word is made a waxing nose
Good Prince can scant wear royal crown
Good laws are made, such shipmen's hose
Ill men misuse, that good men made

# 36

For proud men scorn to yield to troth:
While most men thus do use this trade,
They hazard hard the loss of both.

When all comes thwart and out of frame
Fond fools rejoice, their mates do smile
But wise men learn by others' shame
That foolish joy lasts little while.
Leave thwarting then and walk in truth
Be ruled by high, by old, by wise
For self conceit undoes much youth
And throws such down as else might rise.

This fellow has by figure feigned an alteration in all things and artificially set forth the contrary actions of most men.

# 36v

He find those old versus verified in our time:

His diebus iam peractis,
Nulla fides est in pactis,
Videte:

Mel in ore verba lactic,
Fel in corde fraus in factis,
Cavete.

In these our days foresee the same
No faith in facts is found
Our mouth with milk and honey flows
But gall in heart does bound.

This Poet has placed the steeplt in the bell, he shows how the child corrects his father, the scholar teaches his tutor, the servant calls his master to account, the soldier parts his booty with the peasant, knaves ride and Kings go on foot, and how Princes obey and subjects rule: he has poetically painted

# 37

all things renversed and altered into his contrary.
The loyal duty of the Hollanders, and the obedient condition of the Zeelanders, to their King country, and confiners do manifest the same.
I would feign know what friends of Flushingers do favor, what neighbor for conscience do they space, what love for desert do they bear, what acquittal for any received courtesy, when they contemptuously disdain all the world most currishly.  What confederate may account of them, when their own King is not known to them?
They are religious and yet remember not what the Holy Ghost commands them by Saint

# 37v

Paul in the 13 {Epistle} to the Rom{ans}, saying:
Let every soul submit himself to the authority of the higher powers: there is no power but from God and the powers that be are ordered of God; whosoever therefore resists the power resists the ordinance of God, and they that resist shall get to themselves damnation {Rom. 13}.  Warn them that they submit themselves to rule and power, that they obey Magistrates {Titus 3:2}.
Submit yourselves to all manner of ordinances of man, for the Lord's sake {1 Pet. 3}, whether it be to the King as unto the chief head, either unto rulers as unto them that are sent of him, for so is the will of God: that with well doing you may stop the mouths of foolish and ignorant men, as free, and not as having liberty, for

# 38

a cloak of maliciousness.
But where faith, fear, and obedience fly, there (religion is banished) and falsehood, pride, and arrogance enter.  When piety, devotion, and Christian charity is exiled, then sacrilege, contempt, and hateful malice is nourished.  And when or where these fruits are found and gathered, even then and there, the foulest fiends are fostered.  If you penetrate without partiality their inward parts and by discretion decipher their doings from the first, you shall find them the infective scab, the uncurable scruff, and most filthy scum of the world.  For considering the sundry schisms and sects that are spread through Christendom

(in this our last age) by them, they are no less worthy to be hated for the same than utterly to be detested, for the floods of sinful lust that overflows them.
If the inundation had devoured all when it drowned part, it had been thrice happy for the King but more happier for the country.  God's wrath should not so mightily have kindled against them, as now the heavenly sight of his Divine Majesty is sure to see them: his blessed brow lids ache to behold them, the holiest of his Angels surely do hate them, and the Devils themselves cannot but detest them.  For either they do or may fear that Hell shall be placed among them whose skill may compare with any of them in

# 39

tormenting of souls, seeing they are so expert in the common murdering of bodies.  I read how King Solomon, by his singular wisdom, attained the Philosopher's Stone, whose wonderful virtue he found so precious and worthy that, by the excellency of it, he could constrain, conjure, and bind Sprites to come when and where he would: his judgment, by divine inspiration, was so great in the marvelous property of this stone, as he could punish, imprison, and martyr them at his pleasure.  Wherefore (the better to correct these cursèd caitiffs) he concluded to make a cauldron of copper, no less wide than was needful for his purpose, with a cover so close and just as might be,

# 39v

which, when he had placed deep in the earth where Flushing now is built (as I suppose), he, by virtue of this sacred and holy stone, called all Sprites great and small to gather, beginning at the Emperors of the four corners of the world, their Kings, dukes, earls, barons, colonels, captains, corporals, lance passados, soldiers, stragglers, commoners, and vitlers, withal and as many, both horsemen and footmen, as there were, leaving neither shape nor shadow (no Hobgoblin or Robin Goodfellow) to fear or fray any.  When they were come together (as my author says) by his foresaid virtue, he cunningly caused them to enter into this cauldron, which he covered and closed so artificially with

# 40

LUTO SAPÏENCÏE, as these minions were there thus surely tied forever.
Then bugs walked not, no dead hands for enchanting, or holy candles for conjuring, no witch could harm brewing or hinder churning: all such knavery was couched when these truants were thus (by Solomon's wisdom) tied.
But the envy of unhappy time (by the malice of one of these little monsters, which crept under some clod or turf of earth when the rest were commanded to enter) caused the foundation of lawless Flushing to be framed, where in deep digging, this cursèd cauldron (most cursedly found) was thought to be some hidden treasure.

# 40v

The pioneers labored in hope, the Fiends and Sprites harkened in fear, for they supposed their process was now past and, sentence with judgment concluded, they should be had forth to execution, but so soon as way was made and Monsieurs les Diables (the cauldron once uncovered) seeing no danger but departure, everyone hurled out (in haste) crying liberty, which our Flushingers have ever since been infected with and now most ragingly seek to support (with fire and sword) against their anointed Sovereign.  These Furies thus let at large, and finding (by the sundry alterations of time during their captivity) no more their

# 41

old haunt and parish steeples, have ever since made their abode there, still stirring up sedition, which by a cankered continuance has altered custom into Nature and brought the people of those parts from careless subjects to obstinate rebels.  Such power has corrupt and devilish Sprites over man, when he forgets God, his Prince, and himself.
But as our alchemists (who are by an excellent metaphor called Philosophers) have taken and still take endless toil to attain this holy stone, and yet could never come to the perfection of their enterprise, no more has it been seen that any traitor (for all their cunning and colorable pretexts

# 41v

either to reform usurped authority in others, to claim succession to themselves, to redress common wrongs in general, to remove corrupt members from Princes, to restore and continue ancient privileges, to maintain a commonwealth, to revenge tyranny, or to defend religion), although they take upon them endless toil and travel, that ever performed or brought to their desired purpose the damnable intent of rebellious treason.  For as these miching mates, remembering the subtlety of Solomon and doubting still of danger by virtue of the stone, do in one moment overthrow and break the limbeck of this precious matter, which our poor Philosopher

# 42

(to his infinite charges and great pains, in frying fires and smothering smokes) has been burning, boiling, distilling, and gathering many years.  Even so, when sedition (with Argus's watchful eyes and help of thousand hands) has spread her sparks of uproar and kindled them in self conceit to unquenchable flames, the trembling horror of a traitor's own conscience, his waking fear and sleeping frights, his sudden suspicion and daily distrust, his uncertain counsel and assured jealousy, do all in a moment make such way to desperation that, as the big hart when he hears the little hound, forgets both hugeness and

# 42v

might and all other the benefits of Nature's bounty except his swift foot.  So likewise the rebel, although strong in field (fronted with policy and force, battled with numbers and weapon, and backed with courage and knowledge), at the sight of Prince's sword, does oft forget all, and either calling pardon for mercy fall flat on the ground or turning bridle for fear do only trust to running away.
Notwithstanding the Zeelanders and Hollanders (whose qualities and complexions I am partly acquainted with) are by a peculiar gift of Nature in better predicament.  For when their heads be full fraught with beer, their stomachs full gorged

# 43

with butter, and their bellies full stuffed with bacon, then the simplest is a Solomon, the weakest a Sampson, and everyone armed at the proof to make himself a governor and their state a monarchy.
But commonly such accounts brings chalk and cold words: NULLA DIES ANTE OCCASUM SOLÏS DEBET DÏCÏ CLARA: No day before the sun set should or ought be called fair.
The conclusion (I fear me) by God's Divine Providence will frame such a judicial syllogism for them.  As their conspiring major, rebelling minor, and murdering consequent will prove at the weakest to a hanging argument.

# 43v

In common reason, the continued follies of France should suffice to forewarn any country from sedition and rebellion, but whatsoever is in our sight (be it never so much worthy of wonder) our absurdity is such that (like the ATHEÏSTS) we regard it not as though the rarness more than the greatness of anything should be more accounted of.  For read all histories, turn over all volumes, and look into the jests of the whole world, and you shall find from the first unto this our age no commonwealth's calamity comparable to theirs.  What terrible times have they endured?  What pretended treasons practiced?  What mischief unsurmised?  And what horrible act unexecuted wherein either King or subject might in life be

# 44

touched?  The Prince ever doubtful, the people still desperate, the nobility wracked, the commons spoiled, and between both, their most best and worthiest cut off or murdered.
If valiancy and policy in leaders?  If courage and forwardness in followers?  If martial minds matched with experience?  If willing multitudes, or well appointed numbers?  Or if the justness of any quarrel (in my opinion) either for pretense of title, or maintenance of profession, might in subjects prevail against their Sovereign God's anointed, then surely long since, the House of VALOIS had been clean rooted up and driven out of France.  But what power can withstand the wrath of him who has said, Heaven and Earth shall perish before one jot of my word

# 44v

fail: and he has spoken it to all people and nations, that whosoever rebels against his King rises against and resists him and therefore shall not prevail but be overthrown in his own strength and receive endless damnation for due recompense.
Many have rebelled in this realm and ever reaped reward accordingly, among whom I will remember Owen Glendor, Jack Cade, and the Black Smith, whose repenting (though over late) opinions you shall have, as true testimonies of their own fruitless follies.  But you must imagine that you hear Owen howling from the high mountains in Wales and that you see Jack Cade and the Black Smith preaching on a ladder, shrouded with the Tyburn and shrined with a halter, a meet stage for all traitors

# 45

to make their last triumph on.

Owen Glendor

Was ever woeful wight more pressed
was ever wretch more pained:
Was ever careful caitiff so,
with shame and fear constrained.

Would God in field with Hotspur I
had been at first found dead:
Or with the axe that Percy pulled
I might have lost my head.

But what may rebels wish or choose
since best is shameful death:
With sword in field, with axe on block
or rope to stop our breath.

Yet I most wretch of wretches all,
a worser end did make:
For when the rout of rascal rogues
their leader did forsake.

To mountains lo, I fled alone
myself to hide in cave:

# 45v

From Prince's law and judgment due,
in hope his life to save.

And now amidst these hills I tread,
like hare that hound has lost:
Twixt endless dread and deep despair,
my seely Sprites are tossed.

Each bird, each bush, a foe I deem
each things that steers in eye:
Doth bring new fear and ghastly makes
my faltering limbs to fly.

But whither shall my feeble legs
this cursèd carcass bring:
When every sound seems me to cry,
stay traitor to thy King.

What Hellish hap is me betide,
when heaven and earth deny:
My loathed life, by hateful fate,
his kindly death to die.

Pain bad me yield, shame willed me stay
with hungry chops to fast:

# 46

Which I endured, till double death
constrained me at the last.

To feed on moss, for famine great
on mire and filthy mud:
And in the end to eat my dung
my flesh and eke my blood.

Thus all for pined, I passed my life
among the mountains wild
Bereft of tomb or grave and
from the grace of God exiled.

My lofty time had loathing end,
the fruits that traitors find:
Such right reward to rebels is
from God above assigned.

Jack Cade

If trundle tail of currish kind
with greyhound may compare
Or mastie made to hunt the hog
with spaniel have his share.

# 46v

Then worldly whelps account of me
that durst presume to run:
With swiftest dog and Phaeton like
to soar so near the sun.

Till scorching heat, deciphered plain
my birth and beastly trade
That would have him Prince Mortimer
and yet but poor Jack Cade.

For when I had by Kentish cloynes
the Staffords overthrown:
I climbed aloft and thought the King
and crown to be my own.

But little know we traitors all,
what we do take in hand:
When rebel like, in deed we dare,
against our Prince to stand.

Was never traitor yet prevailed,
but came to shameful end:
Nor never shall attain his will
till God be forced to bend.

# 47

He has appointed Princes sure,
to sit in Kingly seat:
He fights for them, he them defends,
though traitors' force be great.

The wisdom rebels seem to have,
he turns to doltish dreams:
And in the top of hoped joy,
he drives them to extremes.

No subject ought, so God commands,
for any kind of cause:
To dare his Prince, or to resist,
but yield him to his laws.

Though Fortune favor fools awhile,
and lend some happy days:
Yet usance great, for shameful death,
to shameless life she pays.

For I that durst at first presume,
in field with Prince to fight:

# 47v

And then by name of Mortimer,
to claim the crown for right:

Was served of trust by rebel mates,
for they fled every man:
And let me post alone at length
Jack Cade as I began.

What should I do, but run also,
myself in hole to hide:
Where lurk I did, till Iden's search,
my miching place had spied.

There he bereft me of my life,
and horst me like a hog:
And brought me back through London streets,
drawn like a mastie dog.

My cursèd carcass quartered was,
parboiled and trimly dight:
And after at tower gates on poles,
they were as comely pight.

# 48

Then in the sun a roasting set,
because I should not smell:
For carrion crows and worm's meat,
to eat me flesh and fell.

What better tomb or meeter place,
would rascal rebels have:
Than in the bowels of such beasts,
to find their fairest grave.

The Black Smith

To tell my youthly time
or seeds I then did sow:
The flower and fruits declares itself
which here you see me mow.

From forge and fire to field,
and there with Prince presume:
A caitiff smith, his King to dare
deserves no better doom.

Then mark my dear bought tale,
which roughly I declare:

# 48v

Thrice happy is the man that can
by others smart beware.

For fortune finds {findeth} none,
so fit to foil and flout:
As self wild mates and suresby sots,
which cast no kind of doubts.

Was never rebel yet,
that hoist so proud a sail:
Which could against his Sovereign lord,
at any time prevail.

Wise men therefore will first,
debate with doubtful mind:
Then seek to sound, so deep a pool,
and know no ground to find.

For if he once be in,
and entered has the gulf
Let him be sure fast by the ears
to hold a raging wolf.

And hope of aid is none,

# 49

when all among the best:
To tread the tract of traitors' steps,
do utterly detest.

And whom he trusts {trusteth} most
to gain himself a groat:
Will run away, or else betray,
and cut his leader's throat.

How long with raging mates,
may any mind endure
Where troth nor friendship has no hold
there faith cannot be sure.

And if by Prince's force,
he hap to go to wreck
Without all grace he is assured
to lose both goods and neck.

If he in field be slain,
he dies of God accursed:
Which of all ills that happen can,
we ought account the worst.

# 49v

So to be slain in field,
or lain by Prince's ire:
Their bodies are assured of death,
their souls of endless fire.

Then twice accursed is he,
and to be counted mad:
That hopes to save, or else to get,
which rebel never had.

What if by desperate hap,
they chance to win a field:
Shall rebels think they may thereby,
compel their King to yield.

No sure, for where the Prince
has power and grace to reign:
There, if the King would give up all,
yet God will him restrain.

And since he victory gives,
to whom he likes {lykyth} best:
May traitors trust, or hope of it,

# 50

whom God doth most detest.

Though glying tales be told,
that foolish hope might feed:
A rope, such hope, does still assail
and such like death does breed.

To scale as I this wooden fort,
let rebels all be bold:
Then hangman turn the ladder now,
the Smith his tale has told

What should be said touching the rebels of our time, whose follies with their punishments is well known to us: perdition to themselves, their friends, and posterity is the best grain can be gathered of seditious seed, the same they sow, the same they reap, as they manure their matters with treason and mischief, so they mow their own faults with endless sorrow

# 50v

and shameful death.  Ourselves have seen in sundry their sudden rising and momentary falling, even now triumphing multitudes to be feared and straight miserable captives to be pities, even now shapes and bodies of substance and straight shadows of no value or countenance.  So hateful is treason, so loathed is licentious liberty, so embraced is obedience, and so liked is loyal duty, as the rebel's own conscience (which is a near accuser to the best and uprightest liar) will not suffer him to enjoy one minute's quietness.
If therefore in all our actions (before the beginning) we retire our roaming judgment into the bosom of his breeder and look into our own selves, weighing our state, calling, and condition, in the obedient balance of wisdom, fore-

# 51

sight, and discretion, we shall find such security in subjects' duty, such comfort in loyal concord, such joy in common quietness, such delight in mutual dealing, such gain in public, such profit in private, (and specially) such fruits and felicity in Princes' safety, as nothing more.
Where the Sovereign stands, his Majesty honored, his person loved, his presence desired, his absence feared, his laws observed, and his word obeyed, there the subjects live, the nobility prosper, the commons increase, the commonwealth flourishes, and virtue triumphs, to the thrice fortunate fame both of King and country.
Is not the rebel then (that by his sedition seduces many thousands unto him, and by

# 51v

his traitorous attempt bereaves them, the blessing of God, the favor of their Prince, the joy of their wives and children, the use of their goods, and sweet comfort of their country and friends) worthy a well framed gibbet, a pliant halter, and a nimble hangman to send him swinging to the Devil in the midst of his misery?
Such is the fruits and fine of them, such is their reward, and such is the tried treasure that time brings them to.

But our SERENISSIMA of England, our perfect Solomon, whose divine judgment (by deciphering the pretexted pride of the Babylonical beast) has tried out the true

# 52

Mother of the living Child, whose royal favor (by restoring and giving free liberty to the Gospel) has found and received again the forlorn son, whose beneficial bounty (by embracing and suffering the dispersed) is spread through the whole world, whose vailable magnanimity (by force and prudent foresight) does terrify the mightiest of Mars his champions, whose Sovereign Majesty (for politic providence at home and wareful watch abroad) is feared of the foreign and favored of her own, whose gracious government (by 17 years' continuance no less famous than wondered at, and worthily commended, considering the universal calamity of present time) does witness all her Princely proceedings to be accompanied

# 52v

with virtue, joined with upright justice, matched with maidenly pity, maintained with manly diligence, supporting her nobility honorably, and assisting her subjects with Kingly equity.
What may be well said in the perfect praise of her Highness over much when sufficiency of skill in the best (rather than good cause or authority in any) shall want to show the same?  Happy is the realm that has so royal a Queen.  Happy are those councilors that have so Princely a President.  Happy is the court that has so gracious a Mistress.  Happy are the subjects that have such a Sovereign.  And thrice happy is that country and commonwealth which has so careful a governor and vigilant a Keeper, at whose blessed birth all fortunate Fates and

# 53

glad aspect were present (confirming her Majesty with THEODOSIUS'S diligence, ARETAPHILA'S constancy, and ANTIGONUS'S clemency) settling themselves ever since in her Princely breast, as the rareness and greatness of her Grace's virtues declare, whom God preserved from former peril to rule and reign over us, in this last leaden age, wherein iniquity has sought to surmount the glory of his Deity and so presumed to suppress his professors, as if the shield of her Sovereignty (for worldly force) did not protect his poor members among us.  What error would not invade us, what schism or sect would not assault us, what treason would not entrap us when

# 53v

all the evils that may be are crept so near unto us?  Zeeland is full, France not free, and Scotland uncleansed, the common people spoiled, their commonwealths wracked, their nobility murdered, the council condemned, and their Kings disobeyed.  For dissention, sedition, civil slaughter, and rebellion is the only argument entreated of among them.
If therefore it pleased her Highness to use the benefit of present time to bend her brow upon the disobedient, to hold up her threatening hand over them, and to advance her puissant arm towards them, the very shadow of her word would fear and vanquish the proudest of them.
